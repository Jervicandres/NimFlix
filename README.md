# NimFlix

Watch anime online without ads.
Developed using ReactJS, Vanilla CSS, and [Consumet API](https://docs.consumet.org).

## Why I built this app?

Because I wanted to practice Flexbox and CSS Grid in making a responsive list grid with less media query.
I also built this app to improve my knowledge in using React Hooks(useState,useEffect, customHooks,useRef,useContext,useReducer). I didn't use some of the React Hooks I learned (useReducer and useContext) because I I don't think it is necessary to use it here.
